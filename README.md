# Tweet-Marvel

Twitter and Marvel API connection.

Sometimes just for fun, you do this.

It is a simple Node.JS application that tweets the image of your favourite Marvel Superhero on call...
I have provided the list of all character in character_list.txt
You can also add status with the tweet.

This can be used for fun and mainly for fun. And free free free for anyone to use it.

Ohk...I am dumbing down for the steps.(Kidding...Nah...you are an intelligent fellow. :) )

1) Grab the code. Fork the Repo or Clone the Repo or Download the code.
2) Extract it in your local folder.
3) Goto the folder and do 'npm install' (Ohh...Wait i thought you know how to work with NodeJS)
4) And then start the app 'node app.js'
5) Open your browser localhost:3000

!Important
You need to edit 'sample.config.js'. Provide all token secrets inside. And rename it to 'config.js'. 
(Yeah...Yeah...You are clever enough anyway.)

And if you find this cool...tweet me/tag me <a href='https://twitter.com/vishvesh74'>@vishvesh74</a>
