# Tweet-Marvel

Twitter and Marvel API connection.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes just for fun, you do this.
<br>
<br>
It is a simple Node.JS application that tweets the image of your favourite Marvel Superhero on call...
<br>
I have provided the list of all character in character_list.txt (Take the exact name. And dont blame me if Marvel Server doesn't have that superhero image...Are we cool for that?)
<br>
<br>
You can also add status with the tweet.
<br>
<br>
<br>
This can be used for fun and mainly for fun. And free free free for anyone to use it.
<br>
<br>
Ohk...I am dumbing down for the steps.(Kidding...Nah...you are an intelligent fellow. :) )
<br>

1) Grab the code. Fork the Repo or Clone the Repo or Download the code.
<br>
2) Extract it in your local folder.
<br>
3) Goto the folder and do 'npm install' (Ohh...Wait i thought you know how to work with NodeJS)
<br>
4) And then start the app 'node app.js'
<br>
5) Open your browser localhost:3000
<br>
<br>
!Important
<br>
You need to edit 'sample.config.js'. Provide all token secrets inside. And rename it to 'config.js'. 
<br>
(Yeah...Yeah...You are clever enough anyway.)
<br>
<br>
And if you find this cool...tweet me/tag me <a href='https://twitter.com/vishvesh74'>@vishvesh74</a>
